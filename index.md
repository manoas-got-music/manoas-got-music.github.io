**The Problem**: Many UH students are musically talented, but lack an easy way to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. This prevents informal jam sessions and the formation of musical groups.

*Manoa's Got Music* is a web application that allows students to:
- Create a profile with their musical tastes, skills, and goals.
- Share links to performances (YouTube/SoundCloud).
- Connect with other students for collaboration or jam sessions.

## Community Feedback

As part of our community testing, we asked five individuals outside of ICS 314 to try out Manoa‚Äôs Got Music and provide feedback on their experience.

### Key Findings
- **In-App Messaging**: The most common request was the addition of a private messaging feature inside the app. Testers expressed that they would feel more comfortable communicating within the app, rather than having to share private contact information up front.
- **Public Events Calendar**: Several testers recommended a feature to display a public calendar of musical events and performances around Oahu. They suggested allowing users to browse and submit events to foster musical collaboration and awareness.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Some feedback pointed to areas where the app‚Äôs UI could be made more visually polished, including better format on mobile devices.

### Future Considerations
We greatly appreciate this feedback and have added these recommendations to our future development roadmap:
- Integrate a secure in-app messaging system.
- Develop a community events calendar.
- Refine and enhance the user interface for an even better user experience.
