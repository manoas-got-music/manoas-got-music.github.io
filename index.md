## Manoa's Got Music

## Overview

The problem: Many UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.

The solution: The Manoa's Got Music application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship. This application makes use of various tools, including:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Typescript-based implementation of client and server code.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for React-based form design and display.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for type safe database manipulation.

## User Guide
Manoas’ got Music is a free, student developed program that allows Students at UH to Share their music, talk to and meet with other students, and arrange Jam sessions. Simply start by making a profile with your skills/genres/goals, as well as any performances you wish to share, and use that to connect with others. You can filter by genre, instruments, goals, or you can just look around and find a user who interests you in another way. Finally, you can schedule to meet up and jam with another user if you want, whether it be a casual meetup or the beginnings of the next great band is for you to decide!
